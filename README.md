# Voting-Poll
A web application where logged-in users can cast their votes on polls (questionnaires/forms). Admin users can create polls for which users can vote by selecting one or more options. On the main page, all polls in the system are listed. Polls that have already ended are at the bottom, while the ongoing polls appear at the top of the page.
